        @remarks
            This class is a utility class used by both TextureUnitState and
            RenderSystem to wrap up the details of a blending operation. This blending
            operation could be used for blending colour or alpha in a texture layer.
            This class is really only for use by OGRE, since apps can deal with
            blending modes through the TextureUnitState class methods
            setColourOperation and setAlphaOperation.
        @par
            It's worth noting that these operations are for blending <i>between texture
            layers</i> and not between rendered objects and the existing scene. If
            you wish to make an object blend with others in the scene, e.g. to make
            transparent objects etc, use the Material::setSceneBlending method.
